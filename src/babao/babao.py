"""
Module that contains the command line app.

Why does this file exist, and why not put this in __main__?

  You might be tempted to import things from __main__ later, but that will cause
  problems: the code will get executed twice:

  - When you run `python -mbabao` python will execute
    ``__main__.py`` as a script. That means there won't be any
    ``babao.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
  - When you import __main__ it will get executed again (as a module) because
    there's no ``babao.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
