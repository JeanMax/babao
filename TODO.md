# TODO:

* grep -ri todo
* switch to another market api (-> gdax?)
* refactor models as objects?
* babao is now too slow for dry-run on an old raspberry :/ solve that!
    * (might be linked to the recent kraken '0 fee' policy...)


## Work-around'd:

* there is a concurrent access issue with the hdf database (core/graph)
