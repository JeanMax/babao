# TODO:

* grep -ri todo
* add other market api (-> gdax?)
* babao is now too slow for dry-run on an old raspberry :/ solve that!
    * (might be linked to the recent kraken '0 fee' policy...)
* optimize real-time graph: since kraken is (more) laggy, it's really slow
* handle log files
* ideally the test/train data should look like the real-time data (new slice every few seconds)
* write more tests!
* pip package
* refactor graph: one page per crypto, one page for all at once, one menu page
* add type hints
